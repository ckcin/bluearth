# BluEarth

Auto-updating desktop wallpapers from Geostationary satellite imagery in near-real-time. See the earth as seen from above on your desktop.

Initial development notes:
* for Gnome3 only, tested against Centos7 (will expand in future)
* initial imagery from NOAA/NASA GOES satellites (global coverage from other satellites in future)
* location manually set (determining satellite based on location in future)
